DATA PREPROCESSING/ CLEANING 
1. Header Setup: 
 I promoted the correct header row by removing the first two non-header rows to clean 
up the structure. 
 
2. Handling Missing Values: 
Blank cells were filled with “UNKNOWN” to ensure consistency across the dataset. 
3. Data Formatting: 
All text fields were converted to uppercase (except for the Name column) to maintain 
consistency and improve matching accuracy. 
4. Column Splitting: 
I split certain columns to separate key values and make the data more structured and 
easier to analyze. 
5. Fuzzy Matching: 
Used fuzzy matching techniques to identify and align similar subjects and city names 
that may have been spelled differently. 
6. Custom Columns: 
Created a few custom columns to support deeper analysis based on derived values. 
7. Duplicate Removal: 
Removed duplicates by referencing a unique identifier column to ensure clean and 
reliable results. 
8. Keyword Mapping: 
For the Name column, which included mathematical Unicode characters, I created a 
keyword mapping system to interpret and normalize entries effectively. 
DATA STORYTELLING/ INSIGHTS 
My analysis on 4,271 records have revealed several key insights that can guide our strategic 
decisions and improve our services. 
1. Data Gaps Highlight Missed Opportunities:  
A notable number of blank cells were identified across various fields. These gaps point 
to areas where users may be unsure, offering us a clear opportunity to improve our data 
collection methods and better address user needs. 
2. Regional Trends: Africa, with a Focus on Nigeria: 
Our visibility has been driven primarily by engagement from across Africa. This suggests 
a heightened level of activity and preparation among individuals intending to study 
abroad. 
3. Content Reach: Impact of Wakawaka Doctor Partnership: 
Our collaboration with Wakawaka Doctor has proven effective, driving a total of 3,029 
submissions. 
4. Course Interest by Nationality 
When filtering by Nigerian nationality, Computer Science emerges as the most frequently 
selected field of interest. This trend underscores the growing demand for tech-related 
programs among Nigerian students, a valuable insight for tailoring our guidance, 
content, and services. 
RECOMMENDATIONS 
My recommendations will be harmonizing data formats across sources and introducing required 
field(using asterisks) for key data points during submission to reduce missing or incomplete 
entries.
